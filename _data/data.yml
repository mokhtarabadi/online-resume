  details: |
    As an experienced Java Developer with a passion for coding, I have developed a range of skills in object-oriented programming, web development, and app development for Android using Android Studio. My love for coding started at the age of 14 when I began learning JavaScript and building simple web apps. Since then, I have expanded my knowledge and expertise in object-oriented programming, particularly with Java. In 2013, I bought an Android phone, which sparked my interest in app development for Android. I am proud to say that I have since turned ideas into real applications, some of which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mokhtarabadi) page. Additionally, my daily tech usage is documented on [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/@54a1ec34-c863-4117-b416-15ae4f94d9a4).
