    **The history**

    Someone who was once 13 years old knew code and started it at 14 years old!

    First I learned JavaScript and developed simple web apps, then I started learning object-oriented programing, and that's where I met Java.

    In 2013, I bought an android phone, which made a huge change in my life, I dropped everything and put all my focus on app development for Android.

    And now, I can make ideas into real applications.
